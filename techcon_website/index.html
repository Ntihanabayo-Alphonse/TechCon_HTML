                <p>TECHCON is a competitive conference with an acceptance rate of roughly 30%. Please note that
                    acceptance to TECHCON is not solely based on technical content. Other factors, such as proximity to
                    graduation date, may influence selection which allows SRC to create the most robust conference
                    experience possible. Graduate students who have recently graduated or are within a year of
                    graduation are often selected because members are looking to hire SRC Research Scholars. This event
                    is hosted for the benefit of sponsoring companies and supported SRC Research Scholars.</p>
